## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a student performance dataset using **Python**.  
The goal is to understand the structure of the data, explore relationships between student demographics and academic performance, and gain insights through statistical analysis and visualization.

The analysis is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** and is suitable for beginners learning data analysis with Pandas and visualization libraries.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is **StudentsPerformance.csv**, which contains information about students such as:
- Gender
- Race / Ethnicity
- Parental level of education
- Lunch type
- Test preparation course
- Math, Reading, and Writing scores
